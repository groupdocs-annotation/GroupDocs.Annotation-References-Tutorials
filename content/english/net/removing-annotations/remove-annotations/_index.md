## Introduction
Annotations play a crucial role in digital document management, allowing users to highlight, comment, and mark up important sections within files. However, there may come a time when you need to remove annotations from a document. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to remove annotations in .NET using Groupdocs.Annotation, a powerful tool for document annotation and manipulation.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET: Ensure that you have the Groupdocs.Annotation library installed in your .NET project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. Basic Understanding of .NET: Familiarity with C# and .NET programming concepts is essential to follow along with this tutorial.

## Importing Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities provided by Groupdocs.Annotation:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Path
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
In this step, we define the output path where the document with removed annotations will be saved.
## Step 2: Remove Annotations
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated.pdf"))
{
    annotator.Remove(annotator.Get()[0]);
    annotator.Save(outputPath);
}
```
Here, we create an instance of the `Annotator` class by providing the path to the annotated PDF document. Then, we remove the first annotation found in the document using the `Remove` method. Finally, we save the modified document to the output path specified earlier.
## Step 3: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
After removing the annotations and saving the document, we display a success message along with the path where the modified document is saved.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to remove annotations from a PDF document using Groupdocs.Annotation in .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can efficiently manage annotations within your documents, ensuring clarity and precision in your digital workflows.
