## Best Practices for Annotation Removal

When implementing annotation removal in your .NET applications, following these best practices ensures reliable, efficient operations:

**Performance Optimization**: Always use batch operations when removing multiple annotations. Individual removal operations can be significantly slower and may impact application responsiveness.

**Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to manage situations where annotations might be locked, corrupted, or interdependent. Plan for partial failures in batch operations.

**Backup Strategy**: Consider creating document backups before performing bulk annotation removal, especially in production environments where data recovery might be necessary.

**Memory Management**: For large documents or bulk operations, monitor memory usage and consider processing documents in chunks to prevent memory exhaustion.

**Transaction Management**: When possible, wrap annotation removal operations in transactions to ensure data consistency, especially when dealing with multiple documents or complex operations.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Annotation Not Found**: This typically occurs when trying to remove annotations that have already been deleted or when using outdated ID references. Always validate annotation existence before removal.

**Permission Errors**: Some documents may have security restrictions that prevent annotation modification. Check document permissions and ensure your application has appropriate access rights.

**Performance Degradation**: Large documents with many annotations can experience slow removal operations. Consider implementing progress indicators and breaking large operations into smaller batches.

**Format Compatibility**: Different document formats may have varying annotation support. Test your removal operations across all target file formats to ensure consistent behavior.
