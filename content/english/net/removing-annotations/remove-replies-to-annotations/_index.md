# Remove Replies to Annotations in .NET

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to remove replies to annotations in .NET using GroupDocs.Annotation. GroupDocs.Annotation is a powerful .NET library that allows developers to annotate documents with ease. Whether it's adding comments, highlighting text, or adding stamps, GroupDocs.Annotation provides a comprehensive set of tools for document annotation.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET programming.
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
- An understanding of how annotations work in GroupDocs.Annotation.

## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the GroupDocs.Annotation classes and methods in your C# code.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
Load the document that contains annotations with replies using the `Annotator` class.
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated_with_replies.pdf"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Obtain Annotations Collection
Retrieve the annotations collection from the document.
```csharp
List<AnnotationBase> annotations = annotator.Get();
```
## Step 3: Remove Replies
Remove the replies to annotations. For example, let's remove the first reply by index.
```csharp
annotations[0].Replies.RemoveAt(0);
```
## Step 4: Save Changes
Save the changes made to the annotations.
```csharp
annotator.Update(annotations);
```
## Step 5: Save Document
Save the document with the modified annotations to the desired location.
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
## Step 6: Display Confirmation
Display a message confirming that the document has been saved successfully.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
