## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of removing annotations by their IDs using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. Annotations can clutter your documents, and removing them selectively can streamline your workflow. We'll guide you step by step, ensuring you understand each stage clearly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET: Make sure you have installed the GroupDocs.Annotation library for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. Access to Annotated Document: Have a document annotated with GroupDocs.Annotation. If you don't have one, you can follow our previous tutorials to annotate a document.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is required to understand the code examples.

## Import Namespaces
Before we start coding, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Path
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
We define the output path where the document with removed annotations will be saved.
## Step 2: Initialize Annotator
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated.pdf"))
```
Here, we initialize the `Annotator` object with the path to the annotated PDF document.
## Step 3: Remove Annotations
```csharp
annotator.Remove(0);
```
We remove annotations by specifying their IDs. In this example, we remove the annotation with ID `0`. You can replace `0` with the ID of the annotation you want to remove.
## Step 4: Save Document
```csharp
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
After removing the annotations, we save the modified document to the output path specified earlier.
## Step 5: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
Finally, we display a success message along with the path where the modified document is saved.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to remove annotations by their IDs using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. This functionality helps in managing annotated documents more efficiently by selectively removing annotations.
## FAQ's
### Can I remove multiple annotations at once?
Yes, you can remove multiple annotations by specifying their IDs in the `Remove` method.
### Is there a way to undo the removal of annotations?
No, once annotations are removed, they cannot be undone. Make sure to back up your document before removing annotations.
### Can I remove annotations from documents other than PDFs?
Yes, GroupDocs.Annotation supports various document formats including DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and more.
### Are there any limitations on the number of annotations that can be removed?
No, you can remove any number of annotations from a document as long as you specify their IDs correctly.
### Is technical support available if I encounter any issues?
Yes, you can get technical support from GroupDocs.Annotation forum [here](https://forum.groupdocs.com/c/annotation/10).
