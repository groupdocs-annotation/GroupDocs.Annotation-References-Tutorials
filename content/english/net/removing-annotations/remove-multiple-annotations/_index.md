## Introduction
Annotations play a crucial role in document management, enhancing collaboration and communication. However, there are instances where you might need to remove multiple annotations efficiently within your .NET application. In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to accomplish this using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. Let's get started!
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET SDK: Download and install the SDK from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. Development Environment: Set up a suitable development environment, such as Visual Studio, for .NET application development.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces to your .NET project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
Firstly, you need to load the document containing the annotations. You can achieve this by specifying the path to the annotated document.
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated.pdf"))
{
    // Your code here
}
```
## Step 2: Remove Annotations
Once the document is loaded, you can proceed to remove the annotations. GroupDocs.Annotation provides a convenient method to get all annotations and remove them in one go.
```csharp
annotator.Remove(annotator.Get());
```
## Step 3: Save the Document
After removing the annotations, save the modified document to the desired location.
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
## Step 4: Display Success Message
Finally, inform the user about the successful completion of the process along with the path to the modified document.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored how to efficiently remove multiple annotations from a document using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. By following the outlined steps, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, enhancing document management capabilities.
