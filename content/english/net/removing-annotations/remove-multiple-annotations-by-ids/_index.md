## Introduction
In the world of document management and collaboration, GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET emerges as a powerful tool, enabling developers to annotate and manipulate documents seamlessly within their .NET applications. This tutorial will delve into one of the essential functionalities offered by GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET: removing multiple annotations by IDs. By following this step-by-step guide, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of how to efficiently remove annotations, empowering you to enhance your document management capabilities.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Installation of GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
Firstly, you need to have GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the required package from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/) provided by GroupDocs.
### 2. Basic Understanding of .NET Framework
A fundamental understanding of the .NET Framework is necessary to comprehend the code examples and effectively implement the provided solution.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces into your .NET application. These namespaces provide access to the functionalities required for annotation manipulation.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```

## Step 1: Define the Output Path
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
In this step, we define the path where the modified document with removed annotations will be saved.
## Step 2: Instantiate Annotator Object
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated.pdf"))
```
Here, we create an instance of the `Annotator` class, passing the path of the annotated PDF document as a parameter.
## Step 3: Remove Annotations by IDs
```csharp
annotator.Remove(new List<int>{0,1});
```
In this crucial step, we specify the IDs of the annotations to be removed. Multiple IDs can be passed within a list for simultaneous removal.
## Step 4: Save the Modified Document
```csharp
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
After removing the specified annotations, we save the modified document at the previously defined output path.
## Step 5: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
Finally, we notify the user about the successful completion of the process and provide the path where the modified document is saved.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this tutorial has elucidated the process of removing multiple annotations by IDs using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. By following the outlined steps, developers can seamlessly integrate this functionality into their .NET applications, thereby enhancing document management efficiency and collaboration.
