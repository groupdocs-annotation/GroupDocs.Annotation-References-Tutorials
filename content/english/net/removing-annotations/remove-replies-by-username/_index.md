## Introduction
Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET is a powerful tool for annotating documents seamlessly within your .NET applications. Whether you're working with PDFs, Word documents, or any other supported file format, this library simplifies the process of adding annotations, highlights, and comments, enhancing collaboration and document management capabilities.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the world of document annotation with Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Installation of Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET: Begin by downloading and installing the Groupdocs.Annotation library for .NET. You can obtain the library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. Understanding of .NET Framework: Proficiency in .NET programming is essential to leverage the capabilities of Groupdocs.Annotation effectively.
3. Document to Annotate: Prepare the document you intend to annotate. This could be a PDF, Word document, or any other supported file format.
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarize yourself with the C# programming language, as Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET is primarily used within C# applications.

## Import Namespaces
To get started with annotating documents using Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET, import the necessary namespaces into your C# project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Path
Begin by specifying the output path where the annotated document will be saved. You can use the `Path.Combine` method to combine directory paths:
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
## Step 2: Load Annotated Document
Load the document that contains annotations with replies using the `Annotator` class:
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated_with_replies.pdf"))
```
## Step 3: Obtain Annotations
Retrieve the annotations collection from the loaded document:
```csharp
List<AnnotationBase> annotations = annotator.Get();
```
## Step 4: Remove Replies
Remove all replies where the author's name matches the specified user name. In this example, replies authored by "Tom" will be removed:
```csharp
annotations[0].Replies.RemoveAll(x => x.User.Name == "Tom");
```
## Step 5: Save Changes
Save the updated annotations back to the document and specify the output path:
```csharp
annotator.Update(annotations);
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
## Step 6: Display Confirmation
Finally, inform the user that the document has been saved successfully and provide the path to the output file:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
## Conclusion
Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET offers a straightforward and efficient solution for annotating documents within your .NET applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate document annotation capabilities into your projects, enhancing collaboration and document management.
