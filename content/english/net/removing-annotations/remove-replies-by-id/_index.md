Whether you're working with PDFs, Word documents, or other formats, having the capability to manipulate annotations programmatically opens up a world of possibilities. One powerful tool for handling annotations in .NET is GroupDocs.Annotation.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial on removing replies by ID in .NET using GroupDocs.Annotation, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
### 1. GroupDocs.Annotation Installation
Firstly, you need to install GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. You can download the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/) and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation [here](https://tutorials.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
### 2. Basic Understanding of C# and .NET
Familiarity with C# programming language and the .NET framework is necessary to follow along with the examples in this tutorial.
### 3. Annotated Document with Replies
Prepare a document that contains annotations with replies. This document will serve as the input for the removal process.

## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, import the necessary namespaces to access the GroupDocs.Annotation functionalities.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Path
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
Specify the path where you want to save the modified document after removing replies.
## Step 2: Load Document and Annotations
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated_with_replies.pdf"))
{
    List<AnnotationBase> annotations = annotator.Get();
```
Load the document containing annotations with replies using the `Annotator` class and retrieve the annotations collection.
## Step 3: Remove Replies by ID
```csharp
annotations[0].Replies.RemoveAll(x => x.Id == 4);
```
Identify the reply you want to remove based on its ID and remove it from the replies collection of the corresponding annotation.
## Step 4: Save Changes
```csharp
annotator.Update(annotations);
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
Update the annotations with the removed replies and save the modified document to the specified output path.
## Step 5: Confirm Success
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
Display a confirmation message indicating that the document has been saved successfully with the replies removed.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET provides a straightforward solution for managing annotations within documents.
