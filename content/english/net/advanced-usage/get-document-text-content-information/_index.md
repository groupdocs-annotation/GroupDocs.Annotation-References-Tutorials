# Get Document Text Content Information

## Introduction
GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET is a powerful tool that allows developers to seamlessly integrate annotation functionalities into their .NET applications. Whether you're building a document management system, collaboration platform, or any other application requiring document annotation, GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET simplifies the process with its comprehensive set of features and easy-to-use API.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Installation of GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
First, download the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation to set up the library within your development environment.
### 2. Basic Knowledge of .NET Framework
A fundamental understanding of the .NET framework is necessary to effectively utilize GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. Make sure you're familiar with concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and namespaces.
### 3. Development Environment
Ensure you have a suitable development environment set up, such as Visual Studio or any other .NET IDE of your choice. This will be where you write and execute your .NET code.
### 4. Access to Document(s) for Annotation
Prepare the document(s) that you want to annotate using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. These could be PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, or any other supported file format.

## Import Namespaces
To begin utilizing GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET, import the necessary namespaces into your project. This allows you to access the classes and methods provided by the library.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("document.pdf"))
{
    // Your code for document loading goes here
}
```
In this step, replace `"document.pdf"` with the path to your document file. This code initializes an instance of the `Annotator` class, which represents the document to be annotated.
## Step 2: Access Document Information
```csharp
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = annotator.Document.GetDocumentInfo();
```
This code retrieves information about the loaded document, such as the number of pages, dimensions, etc. The `documentInfo` object contains metadata related to the document.
## Step 3: Iterate Through Pages
```csharp
foreach (PageInfo page in documentInfo.PagesInfo)
{
    // Your code for page iteration goes here
}
```
This loop iterates through each page of the document, allowing you to perform actions on individual pages.
## Step 4: Access Text Content
```csharp
foreach (TextLineInfo textLine in page.TextLines)
{
    // Your code for text line processing goes here
}
```
Within the page loop, iterate through each text line on the page. This allows you to access and manipulate the text content of the document.
## Step 5: Perform Annotation
```csharp
// Your annotation code goes here
```
Implement your annotation logic within the appropriate loop. Depending on your requirements, you can add various types of annotations such as comments, highlights, and shapes.
## Step 6: Save Changes
```csharp
annotator.Save("output.pdf");
```
Finally, save the annotated document using the `Save` method. Replace `"output.pdf"` with the desired file path for the annotated document.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET offers a seamless solution for integrating document annotation capabilities into your .NET applications. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can efficiently annotate documents with ease.
