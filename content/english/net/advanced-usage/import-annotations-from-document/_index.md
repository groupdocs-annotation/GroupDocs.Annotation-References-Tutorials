## Introduction
In the realm of .NET development, GroupDocs.Annotation stands as a versatile tool for integrating annotation capabilities into your applications. Whether you're looking to add comments, highlight text, or draw shapes on documents, GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET offers a comprehensive solution. This tutorial will guide you through the process of importing annotations from a document using GroupDocs.Annotation, step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### Installing GroupDocs.Annotation
Firstly, download the GroupDocs.Annotation library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/) provided. Follow the installation instructions to integrate it into your .NET project.

## Import Namespaces
To begin importing annotations from a document, you need to include the necessary namespaces in your project. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
```

Once you've set up the prerequisites and imported the required namespaces, you can proceed with importing annotations from the document.
## Step 1: Initialize Annotator Object
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf-file"))
{

}
```
In this step, create a new instance of the `Annotator` class, specifying the path to the document from which you want to import annotations.
## Step 2: Import Annotations
```csharp
	annotator.ImportAnnotationsFromDocument("result.XML-file");
```
Here, you use the `ImportAnnotationsFromDocument` method of the `Annotator` object to import annotations from the specified document. Make sure to provide the path to the XML file containing annotations.

Finally, ensure proper resource management by disposing of the `Annotator` object using the `using` statement.
