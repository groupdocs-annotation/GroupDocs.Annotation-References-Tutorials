## Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive tutorial on harnessing the capabilities of GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of utilizing this powerful tool to annotate documents effectively. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer to the world of .NET development, this tutorial will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to integrate annotation features seamlessly into your applications.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. .NET Development Environment Setup
Ensure you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine. You can download the latest version of the .NET SDK from the Microsoft website.
### 2. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET Library
Download and install the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library from the provided [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/). Follow the installation instructions to integrate the library into your project successfully.
### 3. Input Document
Prepare a sample document (e.g., "input.xlsx") that you intend to annotate using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. Ensure the document is accessible from your project directory.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, import the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods required to perform document annotation tasks effectively.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
using System;
using System.IO;
```

Now that we have set up our development environment and imported the required namespaces let's dive into generating preview worksheet columns for our document.
## Step 1: Initialize Preview Options
```csharp
PreviewOptions previewOptions = new PreviewOptions(
    pageNumber => new FileStream(Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", $"cells_page{pageNumber}.png"), FileMode.Create),
    (number, stream) => stream.Dispose()
);
```
## Step 2: Define Worksheet Columns
```csharp
previewOptions.WorksheetColumns.Add(new WorksheetColumnsRange("Sheet1", 2, 3));
previewOptions.WorksheetColumns.Add(new WorksheetColumnsRange("Sheet1", 1, 1));
```
## Step 3: Initialize Annotator with Input Document
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.xlsx"))
{
    annotator.Document.GeneratePreview(previewOptions);
}
```
## Step 4: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument previews generated successfully.\nCheck output in {"Your Document Directory"}.");
```

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to generate preview worksheet columns using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. With this knowledge, you can now incorporate advanced annotation capabilities into your .NET applications with ease.
