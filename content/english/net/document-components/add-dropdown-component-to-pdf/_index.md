## Introduction
GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET provides a powerful set of tools for annotating PDF documents programmatically. One useful feature is the ability to add dropdown components to PDF documents, enhancing their interactivity and usability.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
1. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. Development Environment: Have a .NET development environment set up.
3. PDF Document: Prepare the PDF document to which you want to add the dropdown component.

## Importing Namespaces
Ensure that you import the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.FormatSpecificComponents.Pdf;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```
## Step 1: Set Output Path
Define the output path where the modified document will be saved:
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
## Step 2: Initialize Annotator
Create an instance of the `Annotator` class by passing the path of the input PDF document:
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
```
## Step 3: Create Dropdown Component
Define the properties of the dropdown component:
```csharp
DropdownComponent dropdown = new DropdownComponent
{
    Options = new List<string> { "Item1", "Item2", "Item3" },
    SelectedOption = null,
    Placeholder = "Choose option",
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
    CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
    Message = "This is dropdown component",
    PageNumber = 0,
    PenColor = 65535,
    PenStyle = PenStyle.Dot,
    PenWidth = 3,
    Replies = new List<Reply>
    {
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "First comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        },
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "Second comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        }
    }
};
```
## Step 4: Add Dropdown Component
Add the dropdown component to the PDF document:
```csharp
annotator.Add(dropdown);
```
## Step 5: Save Document
Save the modified document:
```csharp
annotator.Save("result.pdf");
```
## Step 6: Display Output Path
Display a message indicating the successful saving of the document along with the output path:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
