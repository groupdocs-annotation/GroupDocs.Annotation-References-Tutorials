# How to Add Ellipse Annotations to PDFs Using GroupDocs.Annotation .NET API

## Introduction

Enhance your PDF documents with interactive annotations, such as ellipses, using the GroupDocs.Annotation .NET API. Whether you're highlighting key sections or providing visual cues, adding ellipse annotations can make your documents more informative and engaging.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
- Creating and customizing an ellipse annotation
- Adding annotations to specific pages in your PDF
- Saving the annotated document

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll guide you through the process of adding an ellipse annotation. Make sure you've met all prerequisites before starting.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, ensure you have:
- .NET Core SDK or .NET Framework installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with C# programming and basic PDF concepts.
- Visual Studio or another compatible IDE for developing .NET applications.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET

### Installation

Start by installing the GroupDocs.Annotation library:

**NuGet Package Manager Console:**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Annotation -Version 25.4.0
```

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Annotation --version 25.4.0
```

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Annotation, you can:
- Sign up for a free trial to test the library.
- Apply for a temporary license to explore all features without limitations.
- Purchase a license for long-term projects.

For setup and initialization:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation;

// Initialize the annotator with your PDF document path
Annotator annotator = new Annotator("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Adding an Ellipse Annotation to a PDF Document

In this section, we'll walk through creating and customizing an ellipse annotation.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Annotator Object

Begin by initializing the `Annotator` object with your PDF document path:
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(inputPdfPath))
{
    // We'll add annotations in this block.
}
```

#### Step 2: Create and Configure Ellipse Annotation

Create an instance of `EllipseAnnotation` with the desired properties:
```csharp
EllipseAnnotation ellipse = new EllipseAnnotation
{
    BackgroundColor = 65535, // Yellow color in ARGB format
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 150), // Position (x, y) and size (width, height)
    CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
    Message = "This is an ellipse annotation",
    Opacity = 0.7f,
    PageNumber = 1, // The page number to add the annotation
    PenColor = 65535,
    PenStyle = PenStyle.Dot,
    PenWidth = 3,
    Replies = new List<Reply>
    {
        new Reply { Comment = "First comment", RepliedOn = DateTime.Now },
        new Reply { Comment = "Second comment", RepliedOn = DateTime.Now }
    }
};
```

#### Step 3: Add the Ellipse Annotation

Add the configured ellipse annotation to your document:
```csharp
annotator.Add(ellipse);
```

#### Step 4: Save the Annotated Document

Save the annotated PDF to a specified output path:
```csharp
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that the paths for input and output documents are correctly set.
- Verify that you have write permissions in your output directory.

## Practical Applications

Adding ellipse annotations can be useful in various scenarios:
1. **Educational Materials:** Highlight important sections or provide visual cues to students.
2. **Technical Documentation:** Emphasize key components or features in user manuals.
3. **Contract Reviews:** Mark areas of interest for further discussion or review.

## Performance Considerations

When using GroupDocs.Annotation, consider these tips:
- Optimize file sizes by compressing images before adding annotations.
- Use efficient data structures to handle large documents.
- Follow .NET memory management best practices for smooth performance.

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, you've learned how to add an ellipse annotation to a PDF document using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. This feature enhances your ability to communicate visually within your documents. As next steps, explore other annotation types available in the API and consider integrating them into your projects.
