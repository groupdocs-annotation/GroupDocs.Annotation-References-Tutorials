namespace DocumentAnnotationApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)

            // Initialize the license object
            License license = new License();
            
            // Apply the license from a file stream
            using (FileStream fileStream = File.OpenRead("YOUR_LICENSE_PATH.lic"))
            {
                license.SetLicense(fileStream);
            }
            
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET is licensed successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Setting License from Stream

#### Overview
Setting a license using a stream provides flexibility, especially when working with dynamic paths or temporary files. This method bypasses the need to hardcode file paths.

#### Implementing License Setup

##### Step 1: Import Required Namespaces
Ensure you have included necessary namespaces for file handling and licensing:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
```

##### Step 2: Initialize the License Object
Create a `License` object which will be used to apply your license.

```csharp
License license = new License();
```

##### Step 3: Apply License from File Stream
Open your license file using a `FileStream` and set it via the `SetLicense` method. This step is critical as it activates all features of GroupDocs.Annotation:

```csharp
string licensePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "YOUR_LICENSE_PATH.lic");

using (FileStream fileStream = File.OpenRead(licensePath))
{
    license.SetLicense(fileStream);
}
```

**Parameters and Method Purpose:**
- `SetLicense(FileStream)`: Applies the license to your application, ensuring full access to GroupDocs.Annotation features.
- `FileStream`: Used for reading your license file from a specified path.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your license file is valid and not expired.
- Verify that the file stream properly points to the license file location.
- Check permissions on the directory where the license file resides.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Annotation can be integrated with various .NET frameworks for diverse applications:

1. **Document Management Systems**: Enhance systems by adding annotation capabilities.
2. **Collaborative Platforms**: Enable real-time annotations in shared documents.
3. **E-commerce Websites**: Allow users to annotate product images and manuals.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
- Use streams efficiently to manage memory usage.
- Regularly update to the latest GroupDocs version for performance improvements.
- Implement asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness.

### Best Practices
- Manage resources by disposing of streams after use.
- Monitor application performance to adjust configurations accordingly.

## Conclusion
