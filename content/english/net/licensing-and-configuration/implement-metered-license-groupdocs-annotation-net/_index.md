namespace DocumentAnnotationApp {
    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            // Initialization code here
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET is set up!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Setting a Metered License

A metered license tracks and manages GroupDocs.Annotation usage. Here's how to configure it:

#### Overview:
Setting a metered license involves initializing the `Metered` class with your public and private keys for authentication.

**Step 1: Initialize the Metered Object**

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.License;

namespace DocumentAnnotationApp {
    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            // Initialize the Metered object
            Metered metered = new Metered();
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Define Your Keys**

Replace placeholders with your actual keys:

```csharp
string publicKey = "*****"; // Replace ***** with your actual public key
string privateKey = "*****"; // Replace ***** with your actual private key
```

#### Step 3: Set the Metered License

Use your keys to set up the license:

```csharp
metered.SetMeteredKey(publicKey, privateKey);
```

**Explanation**: This authenticates your application using GroupDocs' licensing server.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure correct public and private keys.
- Verify internet connectivity for license verification.
- Refer to the API documentation for error resolution.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Annotation can be integrated into various systems:
