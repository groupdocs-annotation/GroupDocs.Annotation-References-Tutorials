## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET

To use GroupDocs.Annotation, you first need to install it. Here’s how:

**NuGet Package Manager Console:**
```plaintext
Install-Package GroupDocs.Annotation -Version 25.4.0
```

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Annotation --version 25.4.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps

GroupDocs offers various licensing options:
- **Free Trial**: Test the library with a temporary license.

// Initialize an annotator instance with input document path
Annotator annotator = new Annotator("path/to/your/document.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Adding a Text Strikeout Annotation

In this section, we’ll focus on implementing the text strikeout annotation feature.

#### Step 1: Define Your Document Paths

Start by specifying your input and output document paths. Replace `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with the actual path to your documents.

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\input.pdf");
string outputPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\output.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Load Your Document

Load your document using GroupDocs.Annotation:

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(documentPath))
{
    // The code for adding annotations will go here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the Strikeout Annotation

Now, let’s create and configure a text strikeout annotation:

```csharp
StrikeoutAnnotation strikeout = new StrikeoutAnnotation
{
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 50), // Specify the position
    PageNumber = 0, // Define on which page to apply
    PenColor = 65535, // Yellow color in RGB
    PenStyle = PenStyle.Dash,
    PenWidth = 2
};
```

#### Step 4: Add and Save Annotations

Add your strikeout annotation to the document and save it:

```csharp
annotator.Add(strikeout);
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that file paths are correct.
- Verify document compatibility (GroupDocs supports various formats).
- Check for updates or patches if you encounter unexpected behavior.

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Review**: Mark incorrect information during peer reviews in collaborative projects.
2. **Legal Documents**: Highlight outdated clauses or terms needing revision.
