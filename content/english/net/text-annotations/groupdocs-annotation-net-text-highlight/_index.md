# How to Add Text Highlight Annotations with GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET

## Introduction
In the digital age, efficient document annotation is crucial for enhancing productivity in projects requiring extensive feedback or highlighting important sections. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET simplifies adding text highlight annotations, making it an invaluable tool for developers.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to add text highlight annotations using GroupDocs.Annotation.
- Key features of the GroupDocs.Annotation library in .NET applications.
- Setting up your development environment to utilize this powerful tool.

Let's dive into the prerequisites and set the stage for a seamless implementation process!

## Prerequisites
To successfully implement text highlight annotations with GroupDocs.Annotation, you need:

### Required Libraries
- **GroupDocs.Annotation**: Ensure you have version 25.4.0 or later installed.

### Environment Setup
- A .NET development environment (such as Visual Studio).
- Basic knowledge of C# and understanding of object-oriented programming principles.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Familiarity with handling files in .NET.
- Understanding of annotation concepts within document processing.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
To start using text annotations, set up the GroupDocs.Annotation library in your project. This setup is straightforward and can be accomplished through various methods:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Annotation -Version 25.4.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Annotation --version 25.4.0
```

### License Acquisition
Before diving into the code, consider your licensing needs:
- **Free Trial**: Test the full capabilities of GroupDocs.Annotation without restrictions.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license to explore extended features for development purposes.
- **Purchase**: For long-term use in production environments, purchasing a license is necessary.

### Basic Initialization
Here's how you can initialize and set up the GroupDocs.Annotation library in your .NET application:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
using System.IO;

string inputDocumentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "input.docx");

// Initialize Annotator with the input document.
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(inputDocumentPath))
{
    // Your annotation logic will go here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down how to implement text highlight annotations step by step.

### Adding Text Highlight Annotations
#### Overview
This feature allows you to emphasize specific parts of a document by highlighting them. It's particularly useful for reviews or collaborative editing where clarity is paramount.

#### Step 1: Create a Highlight Annotation Object
```csharp
HighlightAnnotation highlight = new HighlightAnnotation
{
    BackgroundColor = 65535, // Yellow color in ARGB format.
    CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
    FontColor = 0, // Black color in ARGB format.
    Message = "This is a highlight annotation",
    Opacity = 0.5, // Semi-transparent.
    PageNumber = 1, // Assuming the first page (page numbers are 1-based).
    Points = new List<Point>
    {
        new Point(80, 730), // Top-left corner of the highlight box.
        new Point(240, 730), // Top-right corner of the highlight box.
        new Point(80, 650), // Bottom-left corner of the highlight box.
        new Point(240, 650) // Bottom-right corner of the highlight box.
    },
    Replies = new List<Reply>
    {
        new Reply { Comment = "First comment", RepliedOn = DateTime.Now },
        new Reply { Comment = "Second comment", RepliedOn = DateTime.Now }
    }
};
```
**Explanation:**
- **BackgroundColor**: Sets the background color of the highlight.
- **Opacity**: Controls transparency, making annotations less obtrusive.
- **Points**: Define the rectangle area for highlighting.

#### Step 2: Add Annotation to Document
```csharp
annotator.Add(highlight);
```

#### Step 3: Save the Annotated Document
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "result.docx");
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
**Key Configuration Options:**
- Specify the output path where the annotated document will be saved.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Trial Mode Limitations**: If encountering a trial mode message, ensure you have applied your license correctly.
- **Document Format Issues**: Ensure that the input file format is supported by GroupDocs.Annotation.

## Practical Applications
Text highlight annotations are versatile and can enhance various applications:
1. **Educational Tools**: Highlight key concepts in digital textbooks.
2. **Business Documents**: Emphasize critical points in reports for clarity during presentations.
3. **Legal Reviews**: Mark important clauses or sections for review.
4. **Collaborative Editing**: Facilitate feedback loops by visually marking suggestions.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Annotation:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Manage memory efficiently, especially with large documents.
- **Best Practices**: Dispose of objects properly to avoid memory leaks.
- **Performance Tips**: Use asynchronous methods where applicable for non-blocking operations.

## Conclusion
