# How to Add Text Underline Annotations in .NET Using GroupDocs.Annotation
## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, managing documents effectively is crucial. Whether you're a developer or an enterprise dealing with large volumes of text-based files, adding annotations can significantly enhance document clarity and communication. Imagine effortlessly underlining important sections of your Word documents to highlight key points without manually editing each file. This is where GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET shines, offering robust annotation capabilities that streamline this process.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to leverage GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET to add text underline annotations seamlessly. By the end of this guide, you'll master not only adding underlines but also configuring various properties like color and opacity for your annotations.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET in your project
- Adding underline annotations using C#
- Configuring annotation properties such as font color and opacity
- Integrating this feature into real-world applications
Before we begin, let's ensure you have everything needed to follow along with this tutorial.
## Prerequisites
To get started with adding text underline annotations using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET, make sure you have the following:
- **GroupDocs.Annotation Library**: You'll need version 25.4.0 of this library.
- **Development Environment**: A setup that supports C# development (e.g., Visual Studio).
- **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with C# programming and handling files in .NET.
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
### Installation
**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Annotation -Version 25.4.0
```
**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Annotation --version 25.4.0
```

### Basic Initialization
To initialize GroupDocs.Annotation in your .NET project, start by including the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
```
## Implementation Guide
In this section, weâ€™ll break down how to implement text underline annotations using GroupDocs.Annotation. Each step will be detailed to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.
### Adding an Underline Annotation
#### Overview
The core functionality here is to add an underline annotation to a document, enhancing readability by emphasizing specific sections.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Load the Document**
   Start by creating an instance of the `Annotator` class with your document path:
   ```csharp
   string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.docx");
   using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(inputFilePath))
   {
       // Continue with annotation steps...
   }
   ```
2. **Initialize UnderlineAnnotation**
   Set up the underline properties like creation date, color, and position:
   ```csharp
   UnderlineAnnotation underline = new UnderlineAnnotation
   {
       CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
       FontColor = 65535, // Yellow in ARGB format
       Message = "This is an underline annotation",
       Opacity = 0.7,
       PageNumber = 0,
       BackgroundColor = 16761035,
       UnderlineColor = 1422623, 
       Points = new List<Point>
       {
           new Point(80, 730),
           new Point(240, 730),
           new Point(80, 650),
           new Point(240, 650)
       },
       Replies = new List<Reply>
       {
           new Reply { Comment = "First comment", RepliedOn = DateTime.Now },
           new Reply { Comment = "Second comment", RepliedOn = DateTime.Now }
       }
   };
   ```
3. **Add Annotation to the Document**
   Use the `Annotator` instance to add your underline annotation:
   ```csharp
   annotator.Add(underline);
   ```
4. **Save the Annotated Document**
   Finally, save the document with annotations applied:
   ```csharp
   string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "result.docx");
   annotator.Save(outputPath);
   ```
### Key Configuration Options
- **FontColor & UnderlineColor**: Adjust colors using ARGB values for customization.
- **Opacity**: Set the transparency level of your annotation.
## Practical Applications
Understanding how to add underline annotations can be beneficial in several scenarios:
1. **Document Review**: Highlight sections that require attention during reviews.
2. **Educational Tools**: Emphasize key concepts or instructions in educational materials.
3. **Legal Documents**: Mark important clauses for quick reference.
4. **Technical Documentation**: Underline critical instructions or warnings.
## Performance Considerations
When working with annotations, especially on large documents, consider the following:
- Optimize memory usage by processing documents in chunks if possible.
- Utilize asynchronous operations to enhance application responsiveness.
## Conclusion
You now have a solid foundation for adding underline annotations using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. This feature can significantly improve document clarity and communication across various applications. 
**Next Steps:**
Explore other annotation types available within the GroupDocs.Annotation library to further enhance your documents' functionality.
## FAQ Section
1. **Can I use GroupDocs.Annotation with PDF files?**
   - Yes, the library supports annotations for both Word and PDF formats.
2. **What is ARGB color format?**
   - ARGB stands for Alpha, Red, Green, Blue; it's a way to define colors using opacity and RGB values.
3. **How do I handle errors during annotation?**
   - Wrap your code in try-catch blocks to manage exceptions effectively.
4. **Can annotations be added programmatically in bulk?**
   - Yes, you can loop through multiple documents or sections within a document to apply annotations programmatically.
5. **Is there support for undoing annotations?**
   - While the library allows for adding and saving annotations, removing them requires manual intervention on the document file.
