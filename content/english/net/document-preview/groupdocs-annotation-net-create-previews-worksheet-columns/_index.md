# Generate Targeted Excel Sheet Previews Using GroupDocs.Annotation .NET
## Document Preview Guide
### Introduction
Are you looking to enhance the clarity of your document processing by focusing on specific data points? Whether you're a developer creating data analysis tools, an IT professional managing documents, or anyone interested in streamlining workflows, targeted document previews can save time and improve efficiency. This tutorial will guide you through using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET to generate previews from selected worksheet columns, ensuring your outputs are concise and relevant.

#### What You'll Learn:
- How to set up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
- Generating previews with specified worksheet columns
- Configuring preview options for optimal output
- Practical applications of this feature in real-world scenarios

Let's start by reviewing the prerequisites needed before you begin implementing this solution.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation, ensure that you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Versions:
- **GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET**: Version 25.4.0 or later is required.

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- A development environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed.

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming
- Familiarity with file I/O operations in .NET
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
To get started, you need to install the GroupDocs.Annotation library. Here's how you can do it using different package managers:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```plaintext
Install-Package GroupDocs.Annotation -Version 25.4.0
```

**\.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Annotation --version 25.4.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps:
- **Free Trial**: Download a trial version from the [GroupDocs website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/) to test out features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full access during development at [Temporary License Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: For production use, purchase a license through the [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).
### Basic Initialization and Setup with C#:
Here's how you can set up your environment to start working with GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
// Initialize the Annotator object with a document path.
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsx";
Annotator annotator = new Annotator(inputFilePath);
```
Now that you're set up, let's move on to generating previews from specific worksheet columns.
## Implementation Guide
This guide will walk you through implementing the feature of generating document previews with specified worksheet columns. Each section focuses on a particular aspect of the implementation process.
### Generating Document Previews from Specific Worksheet Columns
**Overview**: This feature allows developers to create document previews that only include selected columns from an Excel worksheet, improving both performance and relevance.
#### Step 1: Define Preview Options
Start by setting up your `PreviewOptions`. This determines how and where your preview files will be saved.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
string outputDirectoryPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
PreviewOptions previewOptions = new PreviewOptions(pageNumber => 
    new FileStream(Path.Combine(outputDirectoryPath, $"cells_page{pageNumber}.png"), FileMode.Create),
    (number, stream) => stream.Dispose());
```
**Explanation**: The `PreviewOptions` constructor takes two delegates. The first specifies the file path for each page's preview image. The second ensures that streams are properly disposed of after use.
#### Step 2: Specify Worksheet Columns
Choose which columns from your worksheet you want to include in the previews by adding them to `WorksheetColumns`.
```csharp
// Include specific columns from Sheet1.
previewOptions.WorksheetColumns.Add(new WorksheetColumnsRange("Sheet1\
