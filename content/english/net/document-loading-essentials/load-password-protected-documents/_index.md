# Load Password Protected Documents

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, collaboration is key to success. Whether you're working on a project with colleagues, clients, or partners, the ability to annotate and share documents efficiently can significantly improve productivity and streamline workflows. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET offers a powerful solution for annotating PDF and other document formats directly within your .NET applications, enabling seamless collaboration and document review processes.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the world of document annotation with GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET, there are a few prerequisites you need to ensure are in place:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
To get started, you'll need to download and install the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided to set up the library in your .NET environment.
### 2. Obtain a License or Use a Temporary License
GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET requires a valid license to unlock its full functionality. You can either purchase a license from the GroupDocs website [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy), or you can request a temporary license for evaluation purposes [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
### 3. Familiarity with C# and .NET Development
A basic understanding of C# programming language and .NET development is essential to effectively utilize GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. If you're new to C# or .NET, consider familiarizing yourself with the language and framework through online tutorials and resources.

## Import Necessary Namespaces
Before you start annotating documents, make sure to import the required namespaces into your C# project. This allows you to access the classes and methods provided by GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET seamlessly.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```

Now that you have the prerequisites in place and the necessary namespaces imported, let's dive into annotating a password-protected document using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you accomplish this task:
## Step 1: Load the Document
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions() { Password = "1234" };
```
In this step, we define the output path for the annotated document and specify the load options, including the password required to open the password-protected document.
## Step 2: Initialize the Annotator
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"_PROTECTED, loadOptions))
```
Here, we create an instance of the `Annotator` class, passing the path to the input document and the load options as parameters. The `using` statement ensures that the `Annotator` object is disposed of properly after use.
## Step 3: Add Annotations
```csharp
AreaAnnotation area = new AreaAnnotation()
{
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
    BackgroundColor = 65535,
};
annotator.Add(area);
```
In this step, we create a new `AreaAnnotation` object, specifying the location and size of the annotation box, as well as its background color. We then add the annotation to the document using the `Add` method of the `Annotator` object.
## Step 4: Save the Annotated Document
```csharp
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
Finally, we save the annotated document to the specified output path using the `Save` method of the `Annotator` object.
## Step 5: Display Confirmation Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
To provide feedback to the user, we display a confirmation message indicating that the document has been saved successfully and specify the location of the output file.
