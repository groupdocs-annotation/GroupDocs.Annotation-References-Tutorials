# Add Text Underline Annotation to Document Using .NET

## Introduction

Ever needed to programmatically highlight important text in documents for review workflows or collaborative editing? Text underline annotations are your go-to solution for drawing attention to critical passages without disrupting the document's original formatting.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn how to add text underline annotations to documents using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. We'll cover everything from basic implementation to advanced customization, plus real-world scenarios where underline annotations shine.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to implement professional-grade document annotation features that enhance collaboration and streamline your document review processes.

## When to Use Text Underline Annotations

Before diving into the code, let's understand when underline annotations are most effective:

**Document Review Workflows**: Perfect for legal document reviews, contract analysis, or academic paper feedback where you need to highlight specific clauses or sections without overwhelming the reader.

**Collaborative Editing**: When multiple team members need to mark important sections for discussion, underline annotations provide a non-intrusive way to draw attention to key points.

**Content Approval Processes**: Editorial teams often use underline annotations to mark sections that require fact-checking or further review before publication.

**Training Materials**: Instructors can use underline annotations to emphasize key concepts in educational documents, making them stand out during presentations or self-study sessions.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET**: Download and install GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. **.NET Framework**: Make sure you have .NET Framework installed on your system.
3. **Development Environment**: Visual Studio or any compatible .NET IDE.

**Pro Tip**: If you're working in a team environment, consider setting up a shared NuGet package source to ensure everyone uses the same GroupDocs.Annotation version.

## Importing Namespaces

First, let's import the necessary namespaces into our project. These imports give you access to all the annotation functionality you'll need:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```

**Important Note**: Make sure to add these using statements at the top of your C# file. Missing imports are one of the most common issues developers encounter when getting started.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down the implementation into clear, manageable steps. Each step builds on the previous one, so you can follow along and understand exactly what's happening.

### Step 1: Define Output Path

```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```

In this step, we define the output path where the annotated document will be saved. The `Path.Combine` method ensures cross-platform compatibility, and we're preserving the original file extension.

**Best Practice**: Always use `Path.Combine` instead of string concatenation for file paths. This prevents issues when deploying across different operating systems.

### Step 2: Initialize Annotator

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
```

Here, we initialize an instance of the `Annotator` class by providing the input document's path. The `using` statement ensures proper resource disposal, which is crucial when working with file streams.

**Memory Management Tip**: The `using` statement automatically calls `Dispose()` when the block exits, preventing memory leaks in production applications.

### Step 3: Create Underline Annotation

```csharp
UnderlineAnnotation underline = new UnderlineAnnotation
{
    CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
    FontColor = 65535,
    Message = "This is underline annotation",
    Opacity = 0.7,
    PageNumber = 0,
    BackgroundColor = 16761035,
    UnderlineColor = 1422623, // works supported only Word and PDF documents
    Points = new List<Point>
    {
        new Point(80, 730), new Point(240, 730), new Point(80, 650), new Point(240, 650)
    },
    Replies = new List<Reply>
    {
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "First comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        },
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "Second comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        }
    }
};
```

This is where the magic happens! We're creating an `UnderlineAnnotation` object with comprehensive properties. Let's break down what each property does:

- **CreatedOn**: Timestamp for audit trails and version control
- **FontColor & UnderlineColor**: Color customization (use RGB values)
- **Opacity**: Controls transparency (0.0 = fully transparent, 1.0 = fully opaque)
- **Points**: Defines the rectangular area to underline
- **Replies**: Enables threaded conversations around annotations

**Color Tip**: The color values are RGB integers. Use online RGB to integer converters, or calculate them programmatically for dynamic color schemes.

### Step 4: Add Annotation to Document

```csharp
annotator.Add(underline);
```

Here, we add the underline annotation to the document. This step is straightforward, but it's where the annotation becomes part of the document structure.

**Performance Note**: If you're adding multiple annotations, collect them in a list and add them in batches for better performance in high-volume scenarios.

### Step 5: Save Annotated Document

```csharp
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```

Finally, we save the annotated document to the specified output path. The original document remains unchanged, and you get a new annotated version.

**Version Control Tip**: Consider adding timestamps or version numbers to your output filenames to maintain clear document history.

## Advanced Customization Options

### Dynamic Color Schemes

You can create more engaging annotations by implementing dynamic color schemes based on annotation types or user roles:

```csharp
// Example: Different colors for different priority levels
int GetPriorityColor(string priority)
{
    return priority.ToLower() switch
    {
        "high" => 16711680,    // Red
        "medium" => 16776960,  // Yellow
        "low" => 65280,        // Green
        _ => 1422623          // Default blue
    };
}
```

### Coordinate Calculation Helper

Working with annotation coordinates can be tricky. Here's a helper method to make it easier:

```csharp
// Helper method for calculating annotation boundaries
public List<Point> CreateRectanglePoints(int x, int y, int width, int height)
{
    return new List<Point>
    {
        new Point(x, y),                    // Top-left
        new Point(x + width, y),            // Top-right
        new Point(x, y + height),           // Bottom-left
        new Point(x + width, y + height)    // Bottom-right
    };
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Annotation Not Visible

**Problem**: You've added the annotation, but it doesn't appear in the output document.

**Solution**: Check your coordinate values. If the points are outside the document boundaries, the annotation won't be visible. Always validate coordinates against document dimensions.

```csharp
// Validate coordinates before creating annotation
if (x > 0 && y > 0 && x < documentWidth && y < documentHeight)
{
    // Safe to create annotation
}
```

### Issue 2: Color Not Displaying Correctly

**Problem**: The specified colors don't match what you see in the output.

**Solution**: Remember that color values are RGB integers, not hex codes. Use this conversion:

```csharp
// Convert hex to RGB integer
int hexToRgb = Convert.ToInt32("FF0000", 16); // Red
```

### Issue 3: Performance Issues with Large Documents

**Problem**: Annotation processing is slow for large documents.

**Solution**: Process annotations in batches and consider using asynchronous operations:

```csharp
// Batch processing example
var annotations = new List<UnderlineAnnotation>();
// ... populate annotations list ...

foreach (var annotation in annotations)
{
    annotator.Add(annotation);
}
annotator.Save(outputPath); // Single save operation
```

## Best Practices for Document Annotation Workflows

### 1. Implement Consistent Naming Conventions

Always use descriptive names for your annotation messages and maintain consistency across your application:

```csharp
Message = $"Review Required: {sectionName} - Priority: {priority}"
```

### 2. Handle Document Format Compatibility

Not all annotation features work with every document format. Always check compatibility:

```csharp
// Check if underline color is supported
bool supportsUnderlineColor = documentFormat == "PDF" || documentFormat == "DOCX";
if (supportsUnderlineColor)
{
    annotation.UnderlineColor = customColor;
}
```

### 3. Implement User Context

Track who created annotations for better collaboration:

```csharp
annotation.Message = $"[{currentUser.Name}] {annotationText}";
annotation.CreatedOn = DateTime.Now;
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Memory Management

When processing multiple documents, implement proper memory management:

```csharp
foreach (var documentPath in documentPaths)
{
    using (var annotator = new Annotator(documentPath))
    {
        // Process annotations
        annotator.Save(outputPath);
    } // Automatically disposed here
}
```

### Batch Operations

For high-volume scenarios, batch your annotation operations:

```csharp
// More efficient than individual Save() calls
var annotationBatch = PrepareAnnotations(textSegments);
annotationBatch.ForEach(annotation => annotator.Add(annotation));
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Server Environments

When deploying to server environments, ensure proper file permissions and temporary directory access:

```csharp
// Use application-specific temp directories
string tempPath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("TEMP") ?? "/tmp", "annotations");
Directory.CreateDirectory(tempPath);
```

### Docker Containers

If you're running in Docker containers, make sure to install the necessary fonts and system dependencies for proper document rendering.
