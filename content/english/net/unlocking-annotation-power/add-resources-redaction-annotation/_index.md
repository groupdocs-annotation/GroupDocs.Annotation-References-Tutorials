GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET emerges as a robust solution, offering a plethora of functionalities to annotate and manipulate documents seamlessly. This tutorial delves into the process of integrating and utilizing Resources Redaction Annotation, a powerful feature within GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. .NET Development Environment
Make sure you have a functional .NET development environment set up on your machine. If not, you can download and install the latest version of the .NET SDK from the Microsoft website.
### 2. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
Download and install GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library from the provided [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/). Follow the installation instructions outlined in the documentation for seamless integration.
### 3. Basic Understanding of C#
Familiarize yourself with the C# programming language syntax and concepts to effectively implement the provided code snippets.

## Import Namespaces
Incorporate the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods for document annotation using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Path
Specify the output path where the annotated document will be saved.
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
## Step 2: Initialize Annotator Object
Instantiate the Annotator object by providing the path to the input document.
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
{
    // Annotation code will be added here
}
```
## Step 3: Create Resources Redaction Annotation
Define a ResourcesRedactionAnnotation object with the desired properties, such as box dimensions, message, page number, and replies.
```csharp
ResourcesRedactionAnnotation resourcesRedaction = new ResourcesRedactionAnnotation
{
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
    CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
    Message = "This is resources redaction annotation",
    PageNumber = 0,
    Replies = new List<Reply>
    {
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "First comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        },
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "Second comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        }
    }
};
```
## Step 4: Add Annotation
Add the created Resources Redaction Annotation to the document using the annotator object.
```csharp
annotator.Add(resourcesRedaction);
```
## Step 5: Save Annotated Document
Save the annotated document to the specified output path.
```csharp
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
## Step 6: Display Success Message
Inform the user about the successful completion of the annotation process and provide the path to the annotated document.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET offers a comprehensive suite of tools for document annotation, empowering .NET developers to enhance document management workflows effectively. By following the step-by-step guide outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate Resources Redaction Annotation into your .NET applications, thereby improving collaboration and productivity.
