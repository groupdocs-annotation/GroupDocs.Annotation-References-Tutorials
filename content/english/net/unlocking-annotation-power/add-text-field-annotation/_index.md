Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation [here](https://reference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/) to set up the library correctly.
### 2. Development Environment Setup
Make sure you have a development environment set up for .NET development. This includes having a compatible IDE such as Visual Studio and .NET Framework installed on your system.
### 3. Basic Understanding of C# Programming
Familiarize yourself with C# programming language basics, as this tutorial will involve writing C# code to integrate text field annotations.

## Import Namespaces
In your C# project, start by importing the necessary namespaces to utilize Groupdocs.Annotation functionalities.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```

Now, let's proceed with adding a text field annotation to a document using Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET.
## Step 1: Define Output Path
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine(Constants.GetOutputDirectoryPath(), "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
## Step 2: Initialize Annotator
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
{
```
## Step 3: Create TextFieldAnnotation Object
```csharp
TextFieldAnnotation textField = new TextFieldAnnotation
{
    BackgroundColor = 65535,
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
    CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
    Text = "Some text",
    FontColor = 65535,
    FontSize = 12,
    Message = "This is text field annotation",
    Opacity = 0.7,
    PageNumber = 0,
    PenStyle = PenStyle.Dot,
    PenWidth = 3,
    Replies = new List<Reply>
    {
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "First comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        },
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "Second comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        }
    }
};
```
## Step 4: Add Annotation to Document
```csharp
annotator.Add(textField);
```
## Step 5: Save Document with Annotation
```csharp
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
## Step 6: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
