## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of adding area annotations to documents using Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET. Area annotations are a valuable feature that allows users to highlight specific areas of a document, providing clarity and context to the content.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET: Make sure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed. You can download them from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. Development Environment: Have a suitable development environment set up for .NET development.

## Import Namespaces
To start with, import the required namespaces into your project. These namespaces contain the classes and methods necessary for working with annotations.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Output Path
Define the output path where the annotated document will be saved.
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
```
## Step 2: Initialize Annotator
Create an instance of the `Annotator` class by passing the document's path as a parameter.
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
{
    // Annotation code will go here
}
```
## Step 3: Create Area Annotation
Define the properties of the area annotation, such as background color, position, message, opacity, etc.
```csharp
AreaAnnotation area = new AreaAnnotation
{
    BackgroundColor = 65535,
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
    CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
    Message = "This is area annotation",
    Opacity = 0.7,
    PageNumber = 0,
    PenColor = 65535,
    PenStyle = PenStyle.Dot,
    PenWidth = 3,
    Replies = new List<Reply>
    {
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "First comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        },
        new Reply
        {
            Comment = "Second comment",
            RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
        }
    }
};
```
## Step 4: Add Annotation
Add the area annotation to the document using the `Add` method of the `Annotator` instance.
```csharp
annotator.Add(area);
```
## Step 5: Save Document
Save the annotated document to the specified output path.
```csharp
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```
## Step 6: Display Success Message
Inform the user that the document has been successfully annotated and saved.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to add area annotations to documents using Groupdocs.Annotation for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can easily enhance your documents with valuable annotations, improving collaboration and understanding.
