## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of adding arrow annotations to your documents using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. Arrow annotations are useful for indicating direction or pointing out specific elements within a document.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
1. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET: Install the GroupDocs.Annotation library for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. Development Environment: Ensure you have a development environment set up for .NET development, including Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.

## Import Namespaces
Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods for annotation.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Options;
```
## Step 1: Initialize Annotator
Initialize the annotator by providing the input document file path.
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine(Constants.GetOutputDirectoryPath(), "result" + Path.GetExtension("input.pdf"));
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
{
```
## Step 2: Create Arrow Annotation
Create an instance of the ArrowAnnotation class and define its properties such as position, message, opacity, pen color, style, width, etc.
```csharp
	ArrowAnnotation arrow = new ArrowAnnotation
	{
		Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
		CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,
		Message = "This is arrow annotation",
		Opacity = 0.7,
		PageNumber = 0,
		PenColor = 65535,
		PenStyle = PenStyle.Dot,
		PenWidth = 3,
		Replies = new List<Reply>
		{
			new Reply
			{
				Comment = "First comment",
				RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
			},
			new Reply
			{
				Comment = "Second comment",
				RepliedOn = DateTime.Now
			}
		}
	};
```
## Step 3: Add Annotation
Add the arrow annotation to the document using the `Add` method of the annotator.
```csharp
	annotator.Add(arrow);
```
## Step 4: Save Document
Save the annotated document to the specified output path.
```csharp
	annotator.Save(outputPath);
}
```
## Step 5: Display Confirmation
Display a confirmation message indicating the successful saving of the document.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nDocument saved successfully.\nCheck output in {outputPath}.");
```
Now you've successfully added an arrow annotation to your document using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET.
