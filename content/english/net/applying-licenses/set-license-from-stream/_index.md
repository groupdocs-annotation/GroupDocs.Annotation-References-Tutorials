# Set License from Stream

## Introduction
Welcome to the comprehensive guide on using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET to enhance your document annotation capabilities. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this tutorial will walk you through each step, ensuring you harness the full potential of this powerful tool.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET: Make sure you have downloaded and installed GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/).
2. License: Obtain a valid license for GroupDocs.Annotation. You can either purchase one from [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) or request a temporary license [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
3. Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the [documentation](https://tutorials.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/) for GroupDocs.Annotation. It provides detailed insights into the API functionalities.

## Import Namespaces
First, let's import the necessary namespaces to start using GroupDocs.Annotation in your .NET project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Check License Path
Ensure that the license file path is correctly set in your project. It should point to the location where your license file is stored.
## Step 2: Set License
```csharp
if (File.Exists(Constants.LicensePath))
{
```
In this step, the code checks if the license file exists at the specified path.
```csharp
    using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead(Constants.LicensePath))
    {
        License license = new License();
        license.SetLicense(stream);
    }
```
If the license file exists, it reads the file stream and sets the license using the `SetLicense` method.
```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
}
else
{
```
If the license file does not exist, it prompts the user to obtain a license from the GroupDocs site.
```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("\nWe do not ship any license with this example. " +
                      "\nVisit the GroupDocs site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license. " +
                      "\nLearn more about licensing at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/faqs/licensing. " +
                      "\nLear how to request temporary license at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license.");
}
```
