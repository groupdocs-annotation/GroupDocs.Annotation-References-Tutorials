{
    License license = new License();
    license.SetLicense(Constants.LicensePath);
    Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
}
```
## Step 3: License File Not Found Handling
If the license file is not found, provide appropriate instructions to obtain either a temporary or permanent license from the GroupDocs website.
```csharp
else

    Console.WriteLine("\nWe do not ship any license with this example. " +
                      "\nVisit the GroupDocs site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license. " +
