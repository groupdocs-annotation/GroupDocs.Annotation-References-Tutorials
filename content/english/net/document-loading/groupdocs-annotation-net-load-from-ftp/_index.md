2. **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
3. **Purchase**: Acquire a full license if you decide to integrate this solution into your production environment.

Here's how you can initialize GroupDocs.Annotation:

```csharp
// Basic initialization of GroupDocs.Annotation
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
{
    // Add annotations here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load Document from FTP

This feature allows you to load a document directly from an FTP server, bypassing the need for manual downloads.

#### Overview of Feature
- **Purpose**: Streamline loading documents for annotation.
- **Key Benefits**: Reduces time and effort in file management, enhances collaboration efficiency.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Set Up FTP Connection**

Create a method to connect to your FTP server and download the document:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Net;

public Stream DownloadFileFromFtp(string ftpUrl, string username, string password)
{
    var request = (FtpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(ftpUrl);
    request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.DownloadFile;
    request.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password);

    using (var response = (FtpWebResponse)request.GetResponse())
    {
        Stream ftpStream = response.GetResponseStream();
        return ftpStream;
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: This method establishes an FTP connection and downloads the specified file. Adjust `ftpUrl`, `username`, and `password` as per your server's configuration.

**Step 2: Load Document into GroupDocs.Annotation**

After downloading, load the document using GroupDocs.Annotation:

```csharp
public void AnnotateDocument(Stream documentStream)
{
    // Initialize Annotator with the stream from FTP
    using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(documentStream))
    {
        // Add annotations or other processing here
    }
}
```

**Explanation**: The `Annotator` object is initialized with a stream, allowing direct annotation on documents fetched from FTP.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure correct FTP credentials and URL.
- **File Access Permissions**: Verify read permissions on the FTP server for the specified file.

## Practical Applications

Implementing GroupDocs.Annotation with FTP loading has numerous applications:

1. **Automated Document Processing Pipelines**: Integrate into workflows that require minimal human intervention.
2. **Collaborative Platforms**: Enhance document review systems where multiple stakeholders need to annotate documents swiftly.
3. **Legal and Financial Services**: Streamline processes involving large volumes of documents needing frequent annotations.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Network Bandwidth Usage**: Ensure your FTP server is configured for optimal data transfer speeds.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Dispose of streams and other resources properly to prevent memory leaks.

### Best Practices
- Use asynchronous programming models where possible to enhance responsiveness.
- Regularly update GroupDocs.Annotation to leverage performance improvements in new releases.

## Conclusion

By now, you should have a solid understanding of how to load documents from an FTP server using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. This integration not only simplifies document management but also enhances your application's efficiency and collaboration capabilities.

### Next Steps
- Explore further features of GroupDocs.Annotation.
- Experiment with different annotation types and configurations.

**Call-to-action**: Implement this solution in your next project to experience the benefits firsthand!
