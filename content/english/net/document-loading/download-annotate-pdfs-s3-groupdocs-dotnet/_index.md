### Basic Initialization and Setup

Hereâ€™s how you can initialize GroupDocs.Annotation in your project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation;

// Initialize the annotator with a file stream or path
Annotator annotator = new Annotator("your-file-path.pdf");
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into two main features: downloading from S3 and annotating documents.

### Feature 1: Download Document from Amazon S3

#### Overview

This feature uses the AWS SDK for .NET to download a PDF document from an Amazon S3 bucket, allowing you to process it further in your application.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Set Up AmazonS3Client**

First, initialize your client and specify your bucket name:

```csharp
using Amazon.S3;
using Amazon.S3.Model;

// Create a client instance
AmazonS3Client client = new AmazonS3Client();
string bucketName = "my-bucket"; // Replace with your S3 bucket name
```

**Step 2: Construct GetObjectRequest**

Set up the request to retrieve your file from the bucket:

```csharp
GetObjectRequest request = new GetObjectRequest
{
    Key = "your-file-key.pdf",
    BucketName = bucketName
};
```

**Step 3: Download the File**

Now retrieve the file from S3 and store it in a memory stream for further processing:

```csharp
using (GetObjectResponse response = client.GetObject(request))
{
    // Create a memory stream to store the file content
    MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
    
    // Copy the response to our memory stream
    response.ResponseStream.CopyTo(stream);
    
    // Reset the position to the beginning of the stream
    stream.Position = 0;
    
    // Return the stream for further processing
    return stream;
}
```

### Feature 2: Annotate PDF Document

#### Overview

After downloading the document from S3, we'll use GroupDocs.Annotation to add various annotations to the PDF.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Initialize the Annotator**

Create an annotator instance using the stream from our S3 download:

```csharp
// Initialize the annotator with the downloaded document
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(downloadedStream))
{
    // Annotation steps will follow
}
```

**Step 2: Adding Annotations**

Let's create and add a simple area annotation to the document:

```csharp
// Create an area annotation
AreaAnnotation area = new AreaAnnotation()
{
    // Define the position and size of the annotation
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
    
    // Set the background color (yellow in this case)
    BackgroundColor = 65535,
};

// Add the annotation to the document
annotator.Add(area);
```

**Step 3: Save the Annotated Document**

Save the document with the applied annotations:

```csharp
// Define an output path for the annotated document
string outputPath = Path.Combine("output-directory", "annotated-document.pdf");

// Save the document to the specified path
annotator.Save(outputPath);
```

## Complete Implementation Example

Here's the complete code for downloading a PDF from Amazon S3 and adding annotations:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Amazon.S3;
using Amazon.S3.Model;
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models.AnnotationModels;

namespace GroupDocs.Annotation.Examples
{
    class DocumentAnnotationFromS3Example
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Starting document annotation from S3...");
            
            // Define your output path
            string outputPath = Path.Combine("output-directory", "annotated-document.pdf");
            
            // Define the key of the file to download from S3
            string key = "sample.pdf";
            
            // Download and annotate the document
            using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(DownloadFileFromS3(key)))
            {
                // Create an area annotation
                AreaAnnotation area = new AreaAnnotation()
                {
                    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
                    BackgroundColor = 65535, // Yellow color
                };
                
                // Add the annotation to the document
                annotator.Add(area);
                
                // Save the annotated document
                annotator.Save(outputPath);
            }
            
            Console.WriteLine($"Document successfully annotated and saved to: {outputPath}");
        }
        
        private static Stream DownloadFileFromS3(string key)
        {
            // Initialize S3 client (assumes AWS credentials are configured)
            AmazonS3Client client = new AmazonS3Client();
            string bucketName = "my-bucket"; // Replace with your actual bucket name
            
            // Create request to get object from S3
            GetObjectRequest request = new GetObjectRequest
            {
                Key = key,
                BucketName = bucketName
            };
            
            // Download the file from S3
            using (GetObjectResponse response = client.GetObject(request))
            {
                MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
                response.ResponseStream.CopyTo(stream);
                stream.Position = 0;
                return stream;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
