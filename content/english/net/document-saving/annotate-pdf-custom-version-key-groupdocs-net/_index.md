# Save Annotated PDFs with Custom Version Keys in .NET Using GroupDocs.Annotation

## Introduction
In today's digital world, managing document versions is crucial for maintaining accuracy and accountability across collaborative projects. How can you efficiently manage and annotate documents while ensuring each version is uniquely identifiable? This tutorial will guide you through the process of saving annotated PDF documents with custom version keys using the **GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET** library. By leveraging this powerful tool, you’ll streamline your workflow and enhance document management practices.

In this article, we'll explore how to implement document annotations and save them with a specific version key, ensuring every iteration is traceable and distinct. Here’s what you’ll learn:
- How to use **GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET** to annotate PDF documents.
- Techniques for saving annotated versions of documents with custom keys.
- Practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Let's dive into the prerequisites before we start implementing this feature.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- **GroupDocs.Annotation** library (Version 25.4.0 or later)
- .NET Framework or .NET Core environment set up on your machine

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure that your development environment is equipped with the following:
- Visual Studio or a similar IDE supporting C#
- A PDF document ready for annotation stored in an accessible directory

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with basic C# programming concepts and understanding of .NET environments will be beneficial. Previous experience with document processing libraries can also help, but it's not mandatory.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
First, we need to set up the **GroupDocs.Annotation** library in your project. You have two primary methods for installing this package:

### NuGet Package Manager Console
Run the following command in the NuGet Package Manager Console:
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Annotation --version 25.4.0
```

### .NET CLI
Alternatively, you can use the .NET Command Line Interface (CLI):
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Annotation --version 25.4.0
```

#### License Acquisition Steps
1. **Free Trial**: You can download a free trial version from [GroupDocs Releases](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/) to test out the library's capabilities.
2. **Temporary License**: If you need more extensive testing, obtain a temporary license via the [GroupDocs Temporary License Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase**: For long-term usage, purchase a license directly from the [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization and Setup with C#
To begin annotating your documents using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET, start by initializing an `Annotator` instance with the path to your document:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
// Define constants for input and output directories
const string INPUT_PDF = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/document.pdf";
const string OUTPUT_PATH = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "result.pdf");

using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(INPUT_PDF))
{
    // Further annotation steps will be added here
}
```
This sets the stage for adding annotations and saving documents with custom version keys.

## Implementation Guide
### Adding Annotations to a Document
#### Overview
In this section, we'll demonstrate how to annotate PDF documents using two types of annotations: `AreaAnnotation` and `EllipseAnnotation`. These will help highlight specific areas in your document.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Annotator
Begin by creating an instance of the `Annotator` class with the path to your input PDF:
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(INPUT_PDF))
{
    // Annotation steps will follow
}
```
The `Annotator` object allows you to manage and apply annotations effectively.

#### Step 2: Create an AreaAnnotation Object
Define the properties of your area annotation, including its position and color:
```csharp
AreaAnnotation area = new AreaAnnotation()
{
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100), // Defines position (x, y) and size (width, height)
    BackgroundColor = 65535,                // Sets ARGB format for background color
    PageNumber = 1                          // Specifies the page number to annotate
};
```

#### Step 3: Create an EllipseAnnotation Object
Similarly, set up your ellipse annotation with desired properties:
```csharp
EllipseAnnotation ellipse = new EllipseAnnotation()
{
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100), // Defines position (x, y) and size (width, height)
    BackgroundColor = 123456,                // Sets ARGB format for background color
    PageNumber = 1                          // Specifies the page number to annotate
};
```

#### Step 4: Add Annotations
Add both annotations to your `Annotator` instance:
```csharp
annotator.Add(new List<AnnotationBase>() { area, ellipse });
```
This step registers your custom annotations with the document.

#### Step 5: Save Annotated Document with Custom Version Key
Finally, save the annotated document and specify a custom version key using the `SaveOptions` class:
```csharp
annotator.Save(OUTPUT_PATH, new SaveOptions { Version = "SECOND" });
```
The `Version` property in `SaveOptions` allows you to assign a meaningful identifier to each version of your document.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that paths for input and output directories are correct.
- Verify the installation of GroupDocs.Annotation via NuGet or CLI before proceeding with annotations.
- If encountering permission issues, check file access rights in your environment.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Annotation is versatile and can be integrated into various real-world scenarios:
1. **Legal Document Review**: Annotate contracts to highlight terms needing attention during review processes.
2. **Academic Feedback**: Provide feedback on student submissions by annotating PDFs with comments or corrections.
3. **Design Collaboration**: Use annotations for collaborative design reviews, marking up documents for design changes.

Integration possibilities extend across .NET systems and frameworks, enhancing document processing capabilities in enterprise applications.

## Performance Considerations
When working with GroupDocs.Annotation, consider these performance optimization tips:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of `Annotator` instances after use.
- Manage resource allocation efficiently to handle large documents smoothly.
- Apply best practices for .NET memory management to ensure application stability and responsiveness.

## Conclusion
You've successfully learned how to annotate PDFs using **GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET** and save them with custom version keys. This capability can significantly improve your document management workflows by ensuring each annotated version is uniquely identifiable.

As next steps, explore further features of GroupDocs.Annotation or integrate this functionality into larger applications.
