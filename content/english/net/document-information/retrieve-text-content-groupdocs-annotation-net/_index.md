// Set the path to your document
const string DOCUMENT_PATH = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

// Initialize Annotator with the document path
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(DOCUMENT_PATH + "/ANNOTATED_DOCX"))
{
    // Further operations will go here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Get Document Text Content Information

This feature allows you to retrieve detailed information about a document's text content, such as page numbers and dimensions.

#### Step 1: Initialize Annotator

To begin with, initialize the `Annotator` object using your document path:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation;
using GroupDocs.Annotation.Models;

// Ensure you have set DOCUMENT_PATH correctly
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(DOCUMENT_PATH + "/ANNOTATED_DOCX"))
{
    // Subsequent operations will be performed within this context
}
```

#### Step 2: Retrieve Document Information

The next step involves retrieving the document information:

```csharp
// Retrieve document information using GroupDocs.Annotation API
IDocumentInfo documentInfo = annotator.Document.GetDocumentInfo();
```

#### Step 3: Iterate Through Pages

To get details for each page, iterate through them:

```csharp
foreach (PageInfo page in documentInfo.PagesInfo)
{
    // Display page number, width, and height
    Console.WriteLine($"Page number {page.PageNumber}, width: {page.Width} and height: {page.Height}");
}
```

**Parameters & Return Values:**
- `IDocumentInfo`: Provides metadata about the document.
- `PagesInfo`: An array of `PageInfo` objects containing details for each page.
