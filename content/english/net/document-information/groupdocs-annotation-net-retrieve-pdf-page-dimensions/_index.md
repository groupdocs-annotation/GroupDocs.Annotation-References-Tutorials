# How to Retrieve PDF Page Dimensions Using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET

## Introduction

Struggling to efficiently retrieve the dimensions of document pages within your PDF files using .NET? This tutorial will guide you through a seamless process, leveraging the powerful capabilities of **GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET**. With this feature, developers can easily access page width and height details, enhancing their application's functionality.

### What You'll Learn
- How to set up GroupDocs.Annotation in your .NET environment.
- Retrieving document metadata using GroupDocs.Annotation.
- Iterating through PDF pages to extract dimensions.
- Practical applications of retrieving page dimensions.

Let’s dive into the prerequisites needed to get started on this journey!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- **GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET** (Version 25.4.0)

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A compatible version of Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Access to a directory with PDF files for testing.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of the C# programming language.
- Familiarity with NuGet package management in .NET environments.

With these prerequisites in mind, let's move on to setting up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET

To integrate **GroupDocs.Annotation** into your project, follow these installation steps:

### Using the NuGet Package Manager Console
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Annotation -Version 25.4.0
```

### Using .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Annotation --version 25.4.0
```

#### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Access limited features to test the library.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full functionality during evaluation.
- **Purchase**: Buy a commercial license for long-term use.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Here's how you can initialize GroupDocs.Annotation in your C# application:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Annotation;

// Initialize Annotator with input file path
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\INPUT_PDF"))
{
    // Your code here to work with document annotations
}
```

With the setup complete, let's dive into implementing the functionality to retrieve PDF page dimensions.

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll explore how to use GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET to obtain PDF page dimensions. The process is broken down into manageable steps for clarity.

### Step 1: Initialize Annotator with Input File

Firstly, you need to initialize the `Annotator` object with your target document:

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\INPUT_PDF"))
{
    // Proceed with retrieving document information
}
```

### Step 2: Retrieve Document Information

Once initialized, retrieve the document’s metadata using `GetDocumentInfo()`:

```csharp
IDocumentInfo info = annotator.Document.GetDocumentInfo();
```

- **Parameters**: None required.
- **Return Value**: An instance of `IDocumentInfo` containing document details.

### Step 3: Check and Display Page Information

Ensure that the page information is available before proceeding:

```csharp
if (info.PagesInfo != null && info.PagesInfo.Count > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"\t Document info: Type {info.FileType}, size = {info.Size}, pages = {info.PageCount}");
}
```

### Step 4: Iterate Through Each Page and Display Dimensions

Now, iterate through each page to display its dimensions:

```csharp
foreach (var page in info.PagesInfo)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"\t\t page #{page.PageNumber}: {page.Width}x{page.Height}");
}
```

- **Parameters**: `PagesInfo` collection from `IDocumentInfo`.
- **Method Purpose**: Outputs the width and height of each PDF page.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your document path is correct to prevent file not found errors.
- Verify that the version of GroupDocs.Annotation is compatible with your .NET framework.

## Practical Applications

Retrieving page dimensions can be beneficial in several real-world scenarios:

1. **Document Management Systems**: Automatically adjust viewing panes based on page size for optimal readability.
2. **PDF Editing Tools**: Provide tools to resize or reformat content dynamically according to the page dimensions.
3. **Data Analysis Software**: Analyze and extract layout information from PDFs containing tabular data.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure your application runs efficiently with GroupDocs.Annotation:

- Optimize resource usage by handling only necessary document pages when processing large files.
- Follow .NET memory management best practices, such as disposing of the `Annotator` object correctly.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have learned how to effectively retrieve PDF page dimensions using **GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET**. This capability can greatly enhance your application's functionality and user experience. To further explore GroupDocs.Annotation, consider experimenting with its various annotation features or integrating it into larger projects.

### Next Steps
- Explore additional annotations like text highlighting and watermarking.
- Integrate GroupDocs.Annotation within cloud-based document management solutions for scalability.
