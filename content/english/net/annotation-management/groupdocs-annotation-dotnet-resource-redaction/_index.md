### Adding Resources Redaction Annotation

**Overview**
In this section, we'll learn how to add a resources redaction annotation. This feature allows you to specify an area within a document that should be redacted or obscured.

#### Step 1: Initialize Annotator
Start by creating an instance of the `Annotator` class with your document path:

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator(inputFilePath))
{
    // We will add annotations here.
}
```

#### Step 2: Create ResourcesRedactionAnnotation Object
Next, create a `ResourcesRedactionAnnotation` object and configure its properties:

```csharp
ResourcesRedactionAnnotation resourcesRedaction = new ResourcesRedactionAnnotation
{
    Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100), // Defines the rectangle area for redaction
    CreatedOn = DateTime.Now,              // Sets when this annotation was created
    Message = "This is a resources redaction annotation\
