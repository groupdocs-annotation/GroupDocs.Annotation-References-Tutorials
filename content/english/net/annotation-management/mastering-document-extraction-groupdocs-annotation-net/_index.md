### Basic Initialization and Setup

Hereâ€™s how you can initialize the GroupDocs.Annotation library in your C# application:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Annotation;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialize the annotator with a document path
        using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Annotation is set up and ready to use.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll walk through extracting information from a document using GroupDocs.Annotation.

### Extracting Document Information

This feature lets you retrieve essential details about your document. Here's how:

#### Loading the Document

First, load the document for annotation:

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf"))
{
    // Proceed with extraction steps below...
}
```

#### Extracting and Displaying Info

Next, extract the document information:

```csharp
// Extract document info
IDocumentInfo info = annotator.Document.GetDocumentInfo();
if (info == null || info.PageCount == 0)
{
    throw new Exception("Unexpected document information!");
}

// Output the extracted document information
Console.WriteLine($"\
File type: {info.FileType}\
Number of pages: {info.PageCount}\
Document size: {info.Size} bytes.");
```

**Explanation**: 
- `Annotator`: Loads and prepares the document for annotation.
- `GetDocumentInfo()`: Retrieves metadata like file type, page count, and size.
- Exception handling ensures robust error management if document info is unavailable.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your document path is correct and accessible.
- Handle exceptions to catch unexpected issues during execution.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Annotation library version matches with your project setup.

## Practical Applications

Understanding how to extract document information opens doors to various real-world applications:

1. **Automated Document Management**: Quickly categorize documents based on metadata for better organization.
2. **Data Validation**: Ensure all necessary fields in a document are filled before processing further.
3. **Integration with CRM Systems**: Automatically update customer records with the latest document details.
4. **Legal and Compliance Checks**: Validate document compliance based on extracted information.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is crucial when handling large volumes of documents:

- Use efficient data structures to store extracted info.
- Minimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly.
- Consider asynchronous processing for high-performance applications.

**Best Practices**:
- Regularly update your GroupDocs library to leverage performance improvements.
- Profile your application to identify and address bottlenecks.
