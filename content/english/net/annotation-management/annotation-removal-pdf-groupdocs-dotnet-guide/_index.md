## Introduction

Are you looking to streamline your document management process by removing unnecessary annotations from PDF files? If so, you're in the right place! In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll explore how to efficiently remove annotations using GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET. By utilizing annotation identifiers (IDs), you can ensure that only specific marks are removed, maintaining the integrity of your documents.

### What You'll Learn:
- How to set up and use GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET
- Step-by-step guide on removing annotations by IDs
- Practical applications of this feature in real-world scenarios
- Performance optimization tips for handling PDFs with GroupDocs

Let's dive into the prerequisites you need before we get started.

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize annotator with a sample document.
        using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/ANNOTATED.pdf"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Annotation initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Removing Annotations by IDs

This feature allows you to precisely remove annotations identified by their unique IDs. Let's break down the steps.

#### Step 1: Load the Document
Begin by loading your PDF document using the `Annotator` class.

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/ANNOTATED.pdf"))
{
    // Document is now loaded and ready for annotation manipulation.
}
```

#### Step 2: Specify Annotation IDs to Remove
Identify which annotations you want to remove by their IDs. This example removes annotations with IDs `0` and `1`.

```csharp
annotator.Remove(new List<int> { 0, 1 });
// The method 'Remove' takes a list of integer IDs representing the annotations.
```

#### Step 3: Save the Modified Document
After removing the desired annotations, save your document to a specified output path.

```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\
