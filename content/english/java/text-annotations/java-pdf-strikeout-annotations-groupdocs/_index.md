# Create Text Strikeout Annotations in PDFs Using GroupDocs.Annotation for Java

**Introduction**

Adding a text strikeout annotation is essential when reviewing legal documents, editing manuscripts, or annotating academic papers. With GroupDocs.Annotation for Java, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your applications. This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on implementing text strikeout annotations using the powerful GroupDocs library.

**What Youâ€™ll Learn:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Annotation for Java in your development environment.
- Adding text strikeout annotations to PDF documents.
- Configuring annotation properties like font color, opacity, and comments.
- Tips for optimizing performance when working with annotations in Java.

Let's start by ensuring you have all the prerequisites!

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Install JDK 8 or later on your system.
- **GroupDocs.Annotation for Java:** Use Maven to integrate this library into your project.
- **IDE:** Utilize an Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

Include the following dependency in your `pom.xml` if you're using Maven:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-annotation</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Environment Setup

Configure your IDE to use Maven for dependency management and ensure JDK 8 or later is installed.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

Having a basic understanding of Java programming, familiarity with annotations in documents, and experience setting up projects using build tools like Maven will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for Java

Begin by integrating the GroupDocs library into your project. If you're using Maven, add the dependency as shown above.

### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Annotation, obtain a license:
- **Free Trial:** Download a trial version from [GroupDocs Downloads](https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/java/).
- **Temporary License:** Request a temporary license at [GroupDocs Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase:** For full features, purchase a license on the [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Initialization

Initialize GroupDocs.Annotation by creating an `Annotator` instance for your document. This object manages all annotations.

## Implementation Guide

We will guide you through adding text strikeout annotations effectively, breaking down the process into logical sections.

### Text Strikeout Annotation

The goal is to demonstrate how to add a text strikeout annotation in PDF documents using GroupDocs.Annotation.

#### Step 1: Configure Document Paths

Define input and output paths for your document:

```java
String inputFilePath = "path/to/your/document/directory/sample.pdf";
String outputPath = "path/to/your/output/directory/AddTextStrikeoutAnnotation_output.pdf";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Annotator

Create an instance of `Annotator` to handle the PDF document you want to annotate:

```java
final Annotator annotator = new Annotator(inputFilePath);
```

#### Step 3: Prepare Replies (Comments)

Add comments or replies associated with your annotations, if needed:

```java
Reply reply1 = new Reply();
reply1.setComment("First comment");
reply1.setRepliedOn(Calendar.getInstance().getTime());

List<Reply> replies = new ArrayList<>();
replies.add(reply1);
```

#### Step 4: Define Annotation Points

Specify coordinates for the strikeout area in your document:

```java
Point point1 = new Point(80, 730);
Point point2 = new Point(240, 730);
List<Point> points = Arrays.asList(point1, point2);
```

#### Step 5: Create and Configure Strikeout Annotation

Set up a `StrikeoutAnnotation` object with necessary properties like font color, message, and opacity:

```java
StrikeoutAnnotation strikeout = new StrikeoutAnnotation();
strikeout.setCreatedOn(Calendar.getInstance().getTime());
strikeout.setFontColor(65535); // Yellow
strikeout.setMessage("This is a strikeout annotation");
strikeout.setOpacity(0.7);
strikeout.setPageNumber(0); 
strikeout.setPoints(points);
strikeout.setReplies(replies);
```

#### Step 6: Add Annotation to Document

Add the configured annotation to your document using `Annotator`:

```java
annotator.add(strikeout);
```

#### Step 7: Save and Dispose

Save your annotated PDF and release resources:

```java
annotator.save(outputPath);
annotator.dispose();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure paths are correctly set to avoid file-not-found errors.
- Validate that the document format is supported by GroupDocs.Annotation.

## Practical Applications

1. **Legal Document Review:** Highlight outdated clauses for revision.
2. **Academic Annotations:** Strike out incorrect answers in study materials.
3. **Proofreading Manuscripts:** Mark sections needing rewrites or deletions.

Explore integrating with systems like document management platforms to automate annotation workflows!

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Memory Usage:** Manage resources efficiently, especially when dealing with large documents.
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple annotations in batches for better performance.

Adhere to best practices for Java memory management to ensure smooth operation of your applications using GroupDocs.Annotation.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to add text strikeout annotations to PDFs using GroupDocs.Annotation for Java. This powerful library not only simplifies document annotation but also offers extensive customization options. Explore further features and capabilities by consulting the [GroupDocs documentation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/annotation/java/).
