# Java Text Strikeout Annotation with GroupDocs.Annotation

In todayâ€™s digital world, documents often require annotations to highlight important information or indicate revisions. Whether you're working on collaborative projects or need to review and comment on documents, the ability to strike out text can be invaluable. This tutorial will guide you through adding a text strikeout annotation using GroupDocs.Annotation for Java, a powerful library designed for document manipulation.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up your environment with GroupDocs.Annotation.
- Step-by-step instructions to implement a text strikeout annotation in Java.
- Practical applications of this feature in real-world scenarios.
- Performance tips and best practices when using GroupDocs.Annotation.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher is required for compatibility with GroupDocs.Annotation.
- **GroupDocs.Annotation Library:** Include this library in your project. The version used here is `25.2`.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for Java

To begin using GroupDocs.Annotation for Java, follow these steps:

### Maven Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file to include GroupDocs.Annotation in your project:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-annotation</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers a free trial, temporary licenses for evaluation purposes, or you can purchase a license for continued use. Visit the [purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) to explore your options.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

After setting up Maven dependencies, initialize GroupDocs.Annotation in your Java application:

```java
import com.groupdocs.annotation.Annotator;

public class DocumentSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Annotator annotator = new Annotator("path/to/your/document.pdf");
        // Proceed with annotation tasks...
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll delve into implementing a text strikeout feature using GroupDocs.Annotation.

### Adding Text Strikeout Annotation

#### Overview
Adding a text strikeout annotation involves defining the area to be struck out and configuring its properties like color, opacity, and page number. This feature is particularly useful for indicating changes or errors in documents.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Initialize Annotator**
   Create an instance of `Annotator` with your document's path:

   ```java
   Annotator annotator = new Annotator("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/dev_sample.pdf");
   ```

2. **Create Replies for Annotations (Optional)**
   Attach comments or replies to the annotations, visible during document review:

   ```java
   Reply reply1 = new Reply();
   reply1.setComment("First comment");
   reply1.setRepliedOn(Calendar.getInstance().getTime());

   Reply reply2 = new Reply();
   reply2.setComment("Second comment");
   reply2.setRepliedOn(Calendar.getInstance().getTime());
   
   List<Reply> replies = Arrays.asList(reply1, reply2);
   ```

3. **Define the Strikeout Area**
   Specify coordinates that form a rectangle for the strikeout:

   ```java
   Point point1 = new Point(80, 730);
   Point point2 = new Point(240, 730);
   Point point3 = new Point(80, 650);
   Point point4 = new Point(240, 650);

   List<Point> points = Arrays.asList(point1, point2, point3, point4);
   ```

4. **Configure the Strikeout Annotation**
   Set properties like font color, opacity, and page number:

   ```java
   StrikeoutAnnotation strikeout = new StrikeoutAnnotation();
   strikeout.setCreatedOn(Calendar.getInstance().getTime());
   strikeout.setFontColor(65535);  // Yellow color
   strikeout.setMessage("This is a strikeout annotation");
   strikeout.setOpacity(0.7);
   strikeout.setPageNumber(0);
   strikeout.setPoints(points);
   strikeout.setReplies(replies);
   ```

5. **Add the Annotation**
   Add your configured annotation to the document:

   ```java
   annotator.add(strikeout);
   ```

6. **Save the Annotated Document**
   Save changes to a new file:

   ```java
   annotator.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/dev.pdf");
   ```

7. **Clean Up Resources**
   Dispose of resources properly:

   ```java
   if (annotator != null) {
       annotator.dispose();
   }
   ```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the coordinates correctly define the area to be struck out.
- Verify that your document path is correct and accessible.
- Check for any exceptions thrown during initialization or saving, which may indicate configuration issues.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where text strikeout annotations can be useful:
1. **Editing Documents:** Mark incorrect information needing revision.
2. **Review Processes:** Highlight changes suggested by reviewers.
3. **Collaborative Workflows:** Indicate sections of a document under discussion or review.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Memory Usage:** Ensure your system has adequate memory resources when working with large documents.
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple documents in batches to manage resource consumption effectively.
- **Efficient Code Practices:** Use efficient data structures and algorithms for handling annotations.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to add a text strikeout annotation using GroupDocs.Annotation for Java. This feature can significantly enhance your document management processes by providing clear visual cues for edits and revisions. 

Next, consider exploring other features of GroupDocs.Annotation like image annotations or hyperlink additions to further enrich your document workflows.
