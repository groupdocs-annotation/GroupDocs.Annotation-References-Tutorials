# How to Add Search Text Annotations to a PDF Using GroupDocs.Annotation for Java

## Introduction

Enhance your PDF documents by adding search text annotations with GroupDocs.Annotation for Java. This powerful feature allows you to quickly reference and highlight specific text, making it ideal for contracts, reports, or any document needing efficient text searching.

### What You'll Learn:
- Setting up GroupDocs.Annotation in a Java environment.
- Step-by-step instructions on adding search text annotations to PDF documents.
- Key configuration options and customization tips.
- Practical applications of this feature in real-world scenarios.

Let's explore the prerequisites before we start.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing search text annotations, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries
- **GroupDocs.Annotation for Java**: Version 25.2 or higher is recommended.
  
### Environment Setup Requirements
- A Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and executing Java code.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming.
- Familiarity with Maven project setup can be beneficial but is not mandatory.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Annotation for Java

To use GroupDocs.Annotation, set up your Java environment properly. Here's how:

**Maven Setup**

Add the following configuration to your `pom.xml` file to include necessary repositories and dependencies:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/annotation/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-annotation</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition
Start with a **free trial** of GroupDocs.Annotation to explore its capabilities or acquire a temporary license for extended evaluation. For long-term use, consider purchasing the full license.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup

To initialize GroupDocs.Annotation in your project, import the necessary classes:

```java
import com.groupdocs.annotation.Annotator;
import com.groupdocs.annotation.models.annotationmodels.SearchTextFragment;
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you have everything set up, let's implement search text annotations.

### Adding a Search Text Annotation

This feature allows you to highlight specific text in your PDF documents, making them easier to search and reference. Itâ€™s especially useful for legal documents or technical manuals where quick access is crucial.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Initialize Annotator**
   Begin by initializing the `Annotator` class with the path to your input PDF document:
   
   ```java
   try (final Annotator annotator = new Annotator("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.pdf")) {
   ```

2. **Create SearchTextFragment Object**
   Create an instance of `SearchTextFragment` to define the properties of your text annotation:
   
   ```java
   SearchTextFragment searchTextFragment = new SearchTextFragment();
   ```

3. **Set Annotation Text**
   Specify the text you want to highlight in the document:
   
   ```java
   searchTextFragment.setText("Welcome to GroupDocs");
   ```

4. **Customize Annotation Appearance (Optional)**
   Customize the font size, family, and colors for better visibility:
   
   ```java
   // Set font size
   searchTextFragment.setFontSize(10);

   // Set font family
   searchTextFragment.setFontFamily("Calibri");

   // Define font color using ARGB format
   searchTextFragment.setFontColor(65535); 

   // Set background color for highlighted text
   searchTextFragment.setBackgroundColor(16761035);
   ```

5. **Add the Annotation to the Document**
   Use the `add` method to include your search text annotation:
   
   ```java
   annotator.add(searchTextFragment);
   ```

6. **Save the Annotated PDF**
   Finally, save the annotated document to a specified directory:
   
   ```java
   annotator.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/result_add_search_text.pdf");
   }
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that your input and output directories are correctly set.
- Check for any syntax errors in the code snippets.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Annotation library version is compatible with your project setup.

## Practical Applications

### Real-World Use Cases
1. **Legal Documents**: Highlight critical clauses or terms within contracts.
2. **Educational Materials**: Emphasize key concepts in textbooks or study guides.
3. **Technical Manuals**: Mark important sections for easy reference during troubleshooting.

### Integration Possibilities
GroupDocs.Annotation can be integrated with document management systems, enhancing collaborative efforts by allowing multiple users to annotate and search documents simultaneously.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Annotation:
- Manage resources efficiently by disposing of objects like `Annotator` properly.
- Monitor memory usage, especially for large PDFs, and adjust Java Virtual Machine (JVM) settings if necessary.
- Follow best practices for Java memory management to avoid leaks.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to add search text annotations to PDF documents using GroupDocs.Annotation for Java. This feature not only enhances document readability but also improves accessibility by making specific sections easily searchable.

### Next Steps
Consider exploring other annotation types offered by GroupDocs, such as area or point annotations, to further enrich your documents.
